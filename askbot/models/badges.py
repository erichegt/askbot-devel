"""This file contains data on badges that is not stored in the database.
there are no django models in this file.
This data is static, so there is no point storing it in the db.

However, the database does have model BadgeData, that contains
additional mutable data pertaining to the badges - denormalized award counts
and lists of recipients.

BadgeData django model is located in askbot/models/repute.py

Badges in this file are connected with the contents of BadgeData
via key, determined as a slugified version of badge name.

To implement a new badge, one must create a subclass of Badge,
adde it to BADGES dictionary, register with event in EVENTS_TO_BADGES
and make sure that a signal `award_badges_signal` is sent with the
corresponding event name, actor (user object), context_object and optionally
- timestamp
